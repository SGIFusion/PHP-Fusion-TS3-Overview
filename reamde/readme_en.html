          <h2>Installation</h2>
        </div>
          <p>Load the folder under the files folder and the infusions folder<br />
to your main directory of PHP-Fusion.<br /><br />

Now go to your administration -> System -> Infusions<br /><br />

Install -> ts3_panel<br /><br />

then call in your administration on infusions -> Teamspeak 3<br />
there you can now make a few entries<br /><br />

Host: IP or link of the TS3 Server<br />
Query Port: is usually 10011<br />
Port: the port of your TS3 server (standard 9987)<br />
Join Passwort: enter your server password if available<br />
The other selection fields are self-explanatory.<br /><br />

click Save Done.<br /><br />

now you can<br />
Administration -> System -> Site Links -> Current navigation links<br />
And edit it if it is only displayed in the navigation panel<br />
Or in the header and the navigation panel or in the header as well as in a new tab / window.<br /><br />
Now you should go to your TeamSpeak&sup3; server (VirtualServer or TeamSpeak&sup3; Hoster)<br />
and there yours <b>whitelist.txt</b> open and enter your domain or the domain IP (Example: Domain = septron.de - IP = 127.0.0.1).<br /><br />
Now you have definitely the problem and get a message of because of: Error Code: 2568 insufficient client permissions etc.<br />
Description for your Right TeamSpeak&sup3; guest right this is from <a href="https://www.tsviewer.com/index.php?page=faq&id=6&newlanguage=en" target="_blank">TSViewer</a>
This error message says that one or more rights the TSViewer does not need on the server are allowed.<br />
<b>Step 1 - enable Advanced permission system</b><br />
Open the TeamSpeak 3 client. Click at the top menubar on <b>Settings</b> and then <b>Options</b>. The Options window is now open.<br />
Click there then on the left sidebar on <b>Application</b> put there then under <b>Misc</b> a check mark at <b>Advanced permission system</b>.<br />
Close now the Options window with a click on the <b>OK</b> Button.<br />
<img src="https://static.tsviewer.com/images/faq/2568_advanced_permissions_en.png"><br /><br />
<b>Step 2 - allow the permissions</b><br />
Dont be suprised, an fresh installed TS3 server does not have this permissions allowed by default. Thats why almost everybody does see this error code 2568 error message<br />
when he wants to use a TSViewer. The following screenshot shows which permissions have to be allowed additionally:<br />
<img src="https://static.tsviewer.com/images/faq/2568_permissions_en.png"><br /><br />
Connect to your TeamSpeak 3 server and open this window by clicking in the top menubar on <b>Permissions</b> and then <b>Server Groups</b>.<br />
First change the display of the permissions to <b>Show names</b> (Dropdown menu in the center at the bottom of this window).<br />
Select now on the left side at <b>Server Group</b> the <b>Guest (8)</b>.<br />
In the center, the mainarea of this window you see the complete permissions of your server divided into categories (Global, Virtual Server, Channel, Group, ...).<br />
Those you can fold out to see which further subcategories and permissions you can find there.<br />
Search now the permissions in their categories and <b>allow them</b> as displayed in the screenshot (by doubleclicking it, a check mark at <b>Value </b> will get set automatically,<br />
with that the permission is allowed then). Should the permission have been already added (black instead of grey text)<br />
and a check mark be missing at <b>Value</b> then allow this permission by setting the check mark at <b>Value</b>.<br />
Actually this is it then. Refresh the TSViewer and see if it does work now. Should it still be not working and the error code 2568 error message still be there then continue reading.<br />
If this still does not work, click the TSViewer link and read the <a href="https://www.tsviewer.com/index.php?page=faq&id=6&newlanguage=en" target="_blank">FAQ</a>.<br /><br />

To be able to use your TS3 also as a panel you must under<br />
Administration -> System -> Panels (left or right) -> New Panel<br />
Name (Your Panelnamen) -> Filename -> ts3_panel -> Enter admin password -> Preview or directly save.<br /><br />

If you are using an older theme, please search in the <b>style.css</b> for:
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">
#ts3_panel {
margin: 0 auto;
overflow: hidden;
padding: 0;
width: 100%;
}
</code></pre></figure><br />

Replace it as follows:
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">
#ts3_panel {
margin: 0 auto;
overflow: hidden;
padding: 0;
width: 180px;
}
</code></pre></figure>
At <b>180px</b>, your exact panel width should be entered
<br />
<br />

That's it already.<br /><br />
